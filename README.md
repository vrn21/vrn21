Junior CS student from Kerala, India. Trying to learn Rust, building a half-finished <a href="https://github.com/vrn21/shorterdb/">key-value store</a>. Interned at <a href="https://fileago.com">Fileago</a>, dabbling in systems programming. Still figuring out most things, but somewhat passionate about databases and low-level tech. Probably won't change the world, but learning along the way.
